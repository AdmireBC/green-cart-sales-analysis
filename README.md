# green-cart-sales-analysis

I analysed customer and sales data from an e-commerce company (Green Cart Ltd) to uncover insights that could drive smarter business decisions.

## Project Goals

- Understand sales performance across product categories and regions
- Analyse customer behaviour by loyalty tier and signup trends
- Identify operational issues such as late deliveries
- Recommend improvements to marketing, discounting, and logistics

## Tools & Skills Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Feature Engineering**: revenue, price bands, delay flags, signup timing
- **Data Cleaning**: handled missing values, duplicates, and typos
- **Visualisation**: built clear, business-focused charts
- **Reporting**: summarised findings and recommendations in a structured PDF


## Key Insights

- **Cleaning** products generated the most revenue, especially in **North and East** regions
- **Gold-tier** customers spent 3x more than other segments
- **Discounts had little effect** on quantity sold
- One region had a **42% late delivery rate**, signalling a fulfilment issue
- Most customer revenue occurred **within 1–2 months of signup**
